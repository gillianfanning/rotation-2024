READ ME:

i used the clinicaltrials.gov code to run queries on feb 6 for my 5 cancers of interest.

the original xml files are on the desktop in the mdx lab, as it is more conservative and efficient for me to have the files there and not on my personal computer.

the xlsx files in this folder are the parsed results from those queries.
